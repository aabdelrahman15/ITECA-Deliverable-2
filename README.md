C2C E-Commerce Platform Prototype

There isn't a mobile-friendly, locally designed C2C e-commerce website in South Africa that caters to informal traders and retains profits domestically. Present issues include:
•	Foreign Platform Dominance
•	Poor Digital Access for Informal Sellers
•	No Dedicated SA C2C Website
Objectives:
•	Build a Mobile-First Website
•	Develop an Admin Dashboard
•	Host Locally
